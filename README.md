<h1 align="center">Kpop Idols API</h1>
<h2 align="center">A fan-built API supplying information about your favorite kpop idol.</h3>



### :construction: This API is actively under construction! ###

#### Tech Stuff:

- This API was created using node.js and Express

- Working with the backend is new for me, and I chose to learn by diving in the deep-end with this API. It has been an education to be sure. I look forward to continuing to explore this part of my tech stack.

#### Improvements/Optimizations coming:

- Documentation! I want this API to be easily navigated by all fans

- Import data to MongoDB. As the data base grows, it only makes sense to store it in a cloud
